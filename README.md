## PyTorch2MLX
Objective: Convert the Hugging Face satetensor model into an MLX implementation, and develop a library for inference on Apple Silicon.  
Future Directions:  
1. Training of LLMs based on Hugging Face (limited to Gemme-2B, Llama3-8B).  
2. Develop a library for converting PyTorch models to MLX models.  
3. Understand methods to optimize and accelerate MLX LLM models for inference.
